Project Name: Acai-Nomz
Project Type:Promotional Website for Acai brand 

Overview
Acai-Nomz is a health-focused food service that specializes in providing smoothie and açaí bowls made from only all-natural ingredients. Aimed to attract customers for avocading healthy yet delightful desserts. The website's primary goal is to enhance the customer experience by offering a visually appealing, user-friendly platform to explore the menu and access information about the acai brand such as the loyalty app. The website is designed to serve both existing and potential customers, offering them a seamless experience while encouraging healthy eating habits.

The website features a homepage with an interactive hero section, a testimonials section showcasing customer feedback, a newsletter sign-up section, and a footer with information about the mobile app and loyalty program. It also includes a mobile-responsive design to cater to all users across different devices.

Design Process
The Acai Nomz website was designed with a focus on providing an easy and delightful browsing experience for health-conscious users who want to discover and order natural smoothie bowls and açaí options. The target audience includes individuals who are seeking healthy, quick meals on the go, as well as customers who are interested in the Acai Nomz mobile app and its loyalty rewards system.

User Stories
As a user, I want to browse a menu of smoothie bowls and açaí options, so that I can find the meal that suits my cravings.
As a user, I want to view customer testimonials, so that I can trust the quality and taste of the products.
As a user, I want to sign up for a newsletter, so that I can receive offers and updates on new products and promotions.
As a customer, I want to easily access the mobile app information, so that I can start using the Acai Nomz app to collect rewards and exclusive offers.
Design Insights
During the design process, we focused on providing a clean and vibrant layout with large visuals of the menu items, making the food the main focal point of the website. The navigation was kept simple to reduce friction and ensure users can easily access the menu, blog, or contact information. The use of the purple color scheme, which matches the brand identity, and the bold typography contributes to a fun and welcoming atmosphere.

Additionally, interactive elements like a testimonial carousel and modal pop-ups were integrated to enhance the user engagement and provide them with an immediate sense of interaction.
